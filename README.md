# Meme-API
This is a simple front-end and back-end application that acts as a resource for meme-text-faces
This is meant to be a proof-of-concept.

## Back-End

The back-end is a REST API made using express and node.js.
It is located in the `backend/` directory.

## Front-End

The front-end is yet to be implemented.
